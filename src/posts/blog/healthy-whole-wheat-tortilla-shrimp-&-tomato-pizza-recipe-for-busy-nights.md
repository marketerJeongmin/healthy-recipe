## Selecting the Right Ingredients

### Whole Wheat Tortillas

Whole wheat tortillas offer a healthier alternative to traditional pizza crust, providing additional fiber and nutrients. When selecting whole wheat tortillas, consider the following:

- Look for 100% whole wheat tortillas with minimal added ingredients.
- Choose tortillas with a higher fiber content (at least 3g per serving).
- Opt for brands that use non-GMO or organic ingredients.

### Fresh Shrimp

Using fresh shrimp ensures optimal taste and texture for your pizza. Follow these tips to choose the best shrimp:

- Purchase raw, peeled, and deveined shrimp for convenience and ease of cooking.
- Select sustainable, environmentally-friendly shrimp options, such as wild-caught or farm-raised shrimp certified by reputable organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC).
- Buy shrimp with a neutral smell, avoiding any fishy odors.

### Fresh Tomatoes

Fresh tomatoes offer superior flavor and texture compared to canned tomatoes. For this recipe, consider the following:

- Select ripe, firm tomatoes with smooth skins and vibrant colors.
- Opt for seasonal options such as Roma or heirloom tomatoes for maximum flavor.
- If you don't have fresh tomatoes, use canned whole peeled tomatoes as a last resort, but be sure to drain and pat them dry before use.

## Cooking Instructions

### Step 1: Preparing the Crust

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Place one whole wheat tortilla on a greased pizza stone or baking sheet.
3. Brush the tortilla with a light coating of olive oil to prevent sogginess.

### Step 2: Preparing the Sauce

Create a simple, homemade tomato sauce using:

- 1 cup of crushed tomatoes
- 1 tbsp of olive oil
- 1 minced garlic clove
- 1 tsp of dried basil
- 1 tsp of dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

Simmer the sauce over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing flavors to meld. Alternatively, use a store-bought tomato sauce for convenience.

### Step 3: Adding Toppings

For the shrimp and tomato pizza, consider the following toppings:

- 1 cup of thinly sliced fresh tomatoes
- ½ cup of cooked shrimp (tails removed)
- ½ cup of shredded mozzarella cheese
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish

Distribute the toppings evenly over the sauce-covered tortilla, focusing on quick and easy options for busy weeknights.

### Step 4: Baking the Pizza

1. Transfer the prepared tortilla pizza to the preheated oven.
2. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.

## Customizing Your Whole Wheat Tortilla Pizza

Get creative with your whole wheat tortilla pizza by trying these personalization ideas:

- Add different vegetables, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, or red onions.
- Experiment with various proteins, including chicken, turkey, or tofu.
- Use different herbs and spices, such as crushed red pepper flakes, paprika, or thyme, to enhance the flavor.
- Try alternative cheeses, such as feta, gorgonzola, or vegan cheese options.
